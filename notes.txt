why do we need Docker?

Compatibility/dependency
long setup time
different envi dev/test/prod
new devloper find difficult to setup

using docker run component in a separate container with own dependencies
and its own libraires.

what can it do?

containerize application
run each service with its own dependencies in separate containers.

it shares common os kernel
differnet types of container LXC,LXD,LXCFS.
DOCKER USE LXC.

it shares commmon kernel not able to run in windows kernel but can run as linux container package.

the main purpose of docker is to package and conrainerized applications and to ship them and to run.

virtual vs container

Virtualization enables you to run multiple operating systems on the hardware of a single physical server, 
while containerization enables you to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single 
virtual machine or server.

virtualtakes up lots of memory while container takes in MB.
virtual any os where container shares kernel and works in other os. 

 image vs package
 image is a package or template used create containers.
  
  containers are running instances of imaged that are isolated and have their own environments  

  docker used create an image for application
  image creates a containers.
  container is a instance of image.

  docker commands:
  --------------------
  docker run nginx(container name)
  docker ps (list the running container)
  docker ps -a (list all container running and stopped previous)
  docker stop name or id(provided)
  docker rm name(to remove permantely the container name)
  docker run -d kodekloud/simple-webapp(command used to run in background)
   docker attach id(to attach in backgroundcontanier) 
   docker images(list images)
   docker rmi used (to remove images)
   docker pull ubuntu(to pull images)
   docker run -d ubuntu sleep 100(sleep after 100sec -d in background)
   docker exec (id) cat /etc/"release" (see content of the particular file in conrainer)

   exec command runs or executes a command on a running container

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
   quiz:

   docker version
   docker ps
   docker images

   run
docker run redis:4.0(to see version)
    docker container does not listen to input
    so it will output the program without reading the input

   
    docker run -i name(interactive mode)
    docker run -it name(t for terminal)

docker should be connect to dockerhost IP,
portmapping:
docker run -p 80:5000 applicationname(p for parameter)
docker run -v /opt/datadir:/var/lib/mysql mysql(to store data externally even if we delete the container)
docker inspect container name(additional details)
docker logs container name(to see logs of -d(deatched mode(background) ) )


docker run ubuntu cat /etc/*release*(to see the version of the image downloaded automatically)
docker run ubuntu:17.10 cat /etc/*release*(specfic version)
